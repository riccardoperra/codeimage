# v1.3.0

This new version of CodeImage add a new editor options: `font ligatures`.

Ligatures are glyphs that combines some sequences of characters into a new form that makes for a more harmonious. They were already present in some CodeImage fonts, but not everyone likes it and in some cases make snippets more difficult to read.

For this reason it has now become an option that can be configured and deactivated directly from the editor.
